### **Session I: Exploratory Visual Analysis with Sketching**

**Objective:** The first session focuses on the iterative process of  exploratory visual analysis and the creative process of formulating research questions on a small dataset. Participants will employ sketching to rapidly explore possible designs while constructing a rigorous design rationale.

**Content:** Participants will start with a small dataset and learn to explore it by identifying trends and formulating questions. practice on the creative process of asking a question, constructing a graphic to address it, inspect the “answer” and then ask new questions, and iterate. 

**Key Topics:**

* **Data Provenance & Bias:** Understanding the origin, intent, and context of data collection. Questions to consider include:  
  * Who collected or produced the data?  
  * What was their intent?  
  * Is it a reputable source?  
  * What are the motives of the data producer?  
  * When was the data collected? How much does the timing matter to the question you are asking about the data?  
* **Exploratory Visual Analysis:** Formulating questions, sketching visualizations, and iterating based on insights.  
  * The students will start by choosing a question they would like a visualization to answer.  
  * Students will design a visualization through the means of sketching, that they believe effectively communicates the question that would like to “investigate”.   
  * Then iterate by exploring more questions with different and diverse design choices (max 3-4).   
* **Process Documentation:** Compiling sketches and questions into a narrative for feedback during a pin-up session. As different visualizations can emphasize different aspects of a data set, students should document what aspects of the data they are attempting to most effectively communicate. Just as important, also note which aspects of the data might be obscured or down-played due to their visualization design.

**Discussion Points for the designs/sketches:**

* What was your motivation behind generating this sketch?  
* What were you hoping it would communicate? And which aspects of the data might be obscured or down-played?   
* What worked well and what didn’t?  
* What did you want to explore in the next sketch?

### **Session II: Asking Questions with Your Audience in Mind**

**Objective:** The second workshop emphasizes the importance of crafting visualizations tailored to different audiences. In this workshop we will explore the role of the audience, taking into account their educational background and familiarity with the topic/subject matter, to refine the research questions as well as the designs/sketches. Goal is to iteratively increase or decrease complexity of the communicated designs and insights depending on the level of expertise of the target audience.

**Content:** Participants will consider how the design of a visualization changes based on the audience, from novice to expert. They will work on refining their research questions and visualizations to effectively communicate with different groups, a) the scientific community, b) children.

**Key Topics:**

* **Audience Analysis:** Understanding the characteristics and needs of different audiences.  
* **Scenario-based Design:** Redesigning/sketching visualizations based on the target audience.
